The annual Cheese Festival is just around the corner, and the grand prize—a golden wheel of Gouda—is on display at the Cheese Museum. You, however, are not a cheese enthusiast. You’re a professional cheese thief, and you’ve been eyeing that golden wheel for months.",
    "Options": [
        "You dress up as a mouse, complete with oversized ears and a tiny tail. Your plan? Infiltrate the museum during the festival, blend in with the cheese-loving crowd, and snatch the golden Gouda when no one’s looking.",
        "You pose as a Swiss tourist named Hans Fondue. Armed with a Swiss Army knife (which has 27 different cheese-related functions), you sweet-talk your way into the museum. Your plan? Distract the guards with cheesy jokes while you cut the golden wheel loose."

    "Conclusions": [
        "Failure: You accidentally knock over a display of Roquefort, triggering the alarm. The security guards chase you, shouting, “Stop, cheese felon!”",
        "Success: You slice through the security ropes, grab the Gouda, and exclaim, “That’s hole-y cheese!” The guards laugh, assuming it’s part of your act."
